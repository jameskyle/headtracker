% Project Name: HeadTracker
% Matlab Function: GetScannerHeadPosition(fid)
%   PreCondition: A valid file descriptor is passed to method. The file contains
%                 a single line of tab deliminated coordinates of 
%                 x, y, z, yaw, pitch, roll. x,y, & z are given as absolute
%                 positionals. Yaw, pitch, and roll are given as angles. 
%
%   PostCondition: x_shift, y_shift, z_shift, yaw,pitch, and roll are assigned 
%                  the values contained within the passed file. this implies a 
%                  valid read is Performed on the file. 
%                  If the the read fails, no values are assigned to the 
%                  positional variables.
